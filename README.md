# Customer_Loyalty_Program
Customer Segmentation and Proposed Targeted Loyalty Program

## Goal
1. Analyze customers' annual spending
2. Decide whether to introduce a loyalty program that incentivizes customers to purchase across multiple offering categories
3. Attract the largest subgroup of customers
Keyword: across categories, largest subgroup of customers

## Key Findings and Business Insights
1. The behavior of customers are studied by their consumption correlation across categories. Principal component analysis and K-means are applied for customer segmentation.
2. Multiple loyalty programs are proposed under different scenario.
3. The royalty program should be revisited some time after the program introduced, in order to examine the effect of the program. (or try a smaller scale program experiment on targeted customers first before launching the full-scale program.)
4. For future data collection, it is good to have more frequent data. If the quarterly or monthly data is available, seasonality can be studied and it is possible to introduce the loyalty program on rotating categories.
